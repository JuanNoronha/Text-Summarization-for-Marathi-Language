Text summarization for the Marathi language is a critical task in natural language processing (NLP). It entails the automated creation of a condensed version of Marathi text while retaining its essential concepts. With the exponential growth of user-generated Marathi content on social media, news articles, and online forums, the demand for efficient text summarization has surged. Machine learning-based systems have emerged as key players in automating this process. These systems leverage algorithms trained on massive Marathi text datasets to identify and categorize key information accurately and at scale. By decoding the core insights of Marathi text, text summarization empowers users to quickly grasp the gist of content and make informed decisions.
